SCROLLBoot
==========

Small SCROLL boot demo application build with Scala to show how to use [SCROLL][scroll] (*SCala ROLes Language*) in your Scala project.

**Edit and develop:**

1. Install [SBT][sbt] (Scala Build Tool).

2. Clone this repository.

3. Set up your favorite IDE:
  1. For Intellij: use the built-in import SBT project functionality.
  2. For Eclipse: you may want to use SBT and run ```eclipse``` (to config see [here][gen-eclipse]).

4. Run it with ```sbt run``` or directly with your IDE as Scala Application (```src/main/scala/SCROLLBoot.scala```).
